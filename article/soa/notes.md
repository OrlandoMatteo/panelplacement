## Enabling Positive Energy Districts across Europe: energy efficiency couples renewable energy
handle energy performance targets by moving beyond individual buildings towards a district level.

From a financial point of view, a zero-energy district (ZED) or positive energy district (PED) project needs to be investible whilst providing the municipality and district-dwellers with low-carbon solutions that provide co-benefits to the citizens and local authorities 

## Correlation Analysis of the Spread of Household-Sized Photovoltaic Power Plants and Various District Indicators: A Case Study

> The examination of the relationships also involved, in addition to correlations by pairs, the relationships of the ranking of the districts according to the complex indicators created from the district indicators and the ranking of the districts based on the number and power of photovoltaic HMKEs per 1000 members of the population. By exploring correlations, the paper seeks to establish a regression model for the number of photovoltaic HMKEs and the territorial (district) indicators.

They rank the district according to the number of panels thay can host

## Optimal operation of a residential district-level combinedphotovoltaic/natural gas power and cooling system

> In this paper, we describe the optimal integrationof a CHP plant as a utility producer for a residential district, and the potential for combining CHP withphotovoltaic power generation

They study hoiw to optimize the strategy of integration of PV and gas at a distric level but they do not exploit the placement but they analize a whole district

## Optimal sizing and placement of rooftop solarphotovoltaic at Kabul city real distribution network

They analye how to connect to the grid the area available for the pv panels installation in order to minimize the power loss of the grid.

## 8257681

They estimate the power potential of an entire island of Indonesia to identify the best area to be used for the panel placemen

The same as before but for the city of Mekkah

## el2020optimal

Work similar to our but they provide standard configuration among with to choose
